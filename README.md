Shift 2D
==========================
Target is to provide a simple Qt/C++ 3D Interface. Life's too short to learn shaders. And Qt3D has (IMHO) too much overhead. Qt delivers everything you need (QOpenGLWidget, QOpenGLShader). Why not having just a KISS-Interface for simple 3D-Apps?

- [x] Hello world in just a few lines of code.
- [x] Just Qt, OpenGL and C++. No extra dependencies.
- [x] Class-Library. Just include the profile. Step through the code.
- [ ] API unstable! Work in progress...
